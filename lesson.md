## Introducing the Shell

Link to lesson is [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/)

* Make sure to optimize space by running the command `PS1='$ `. 
* What does a computer do?
* What is a GUI?
* The REPL acronym: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
* Set the stage for our lesson (i.e. we are all Nelle)


## Navigating Files and Directories

Before getting started need to go over the general layout of the filesystem in the UNIX environment. The link to the lesson can be found [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/).

**Key points to hit in this example include:**

* General structure and overview
* Absolute path
* Relative path

Need to point out that the file system if using Git Bash may be slightly different than what they are used to.
i.e. my path to the desktop is: `/mnt/c/Users/marc/Desktop`
 * so my `home` directory is in the `root` directory that also has `mnt`, `root`, `opt`, etc.
  * `mnt` commonly is used for mounted drives (e.g. `c` in this case)
